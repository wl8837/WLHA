We did not have any error with our tables for milestone 4.

Therefore, we perform pardo to sort out non-null values in a state column in location table.

Later,
And we may try to pardo to create a new column with range of temperature in temperature 
table by using values of max. temperature and min. temperature.


For second dataset,
we need to cleanse the time table for data attributes because its type is timestamp. Therefore, we will make its type date.
And we have to transform our state attribute in the location table to abbreviation form.
