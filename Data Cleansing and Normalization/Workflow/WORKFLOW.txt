Create a transformed table for the duration of each storm by calculating the range of begin date and end date 
in Time table of the second dataset (dataset2)
- First, select event id, begin date, and end date from the Time table 
  -- this table will be named create_duration_table
  -- if we can do, we can also select storm name with event id from the Storm_event table in dataset2
- Secondly, transform them to a table named 'Duration' by calculating the range of the dates
  -- this table will be named transform_duration_table
  -- this table will have attributes as event id and duration (maybe storm name too)
- these will belong to the second dataset workflow
- The transform_duration_table which transforms data task is dependent on the create_duration_table
